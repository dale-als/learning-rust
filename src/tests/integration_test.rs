// integration tests are entirely external to your library.
// They use your library in the same way any other code would,
// which means they can only call functions that are part of your libraryâ€™s public API.
// Their purpose is to test whether many parts of your library work together correctly.
// Units of code that work correctly on their own could have problems when integrated,
// so test coverage of the integrated code is important as well.
// To create integration tests, you first need a tests directory.

// !! Integration tests in separate tesrs directory only works with library package (lib.rs)
// include your library with use %library_name% where library name is from Cargo.toml
